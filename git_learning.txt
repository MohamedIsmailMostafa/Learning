Git Definitions:
================
staged:
	Files are ready to be committed.
unstaged:
	Files with changes that have not been prepared to be committed.
untracked:
	Files aren't tracked by Git yet. This usually indicates a newly created file.
deleted:
	File has been deleted and is waiting to be removed from Git.
Staging Area:
	A place where we can group files together before we "commit" them to Git.
Commit
	A "commit" is a snapshot of our repository. This way if we ever need to look back at the changes we've made (or if someone else does), we will see a nice timeline of all changes.
git remote:
	Git doesn't care what you name your remotes, but it's typical to name your main one origin.
HEAD:
The HEAD is a pointer that holds your position within all your different commits. By default HEAD points to your most recent commit, so it can be used as a quick way to reference that commit without having to look up the SHA.
Branches: 
	Branchesare what naturally happens when you want to work on multiple features at the same time. You wouldn't want to end up with a master branch which has Feature A half done and Feature B half done.
	Rather you'd separate the code base into two "snapshots" (branches) and work on and commit to them separately. As soon as one was ready, you might merge this branch back into the master branch and push it to the remote server.
Pull Requests:
	If you're hosting your repo on GitHub, you can do something called a pull request.
	A pull request allows the boss of the project to look through your changes and make comments before deciding to merge in the change. It's a really great feature that is used all the time for remote workers and open-source projects.
Merge Conflicts
	Merge Conflicts can occur when changes are made to a file at the same time. A lot of people get really scared when a conflict happens, but fear not! They aren't that scary, you just need to decide which code to keep.
Force delete
	What if you have been working on a feature branch and you decide you really don't want this feature anymore? You might decide to delete the branch since you're scrapping the idea. You'll notice that git branch -d bad_feature doesn't work. This is because -d won't let you delete something that hasn't been merged.
	You can either add the --force (-f) option or use -D which combines -d -f together into one command.
Resolving SSL self signed certificate error
	when you get this error:  SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain, 
	set GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true

git remote set-url origin https://MohamedIsmailMostafa:GHSom3aa1980!@github.com/MohamedIsmailMostafa/hello-world

git remote add origin https://MohamedIsmailMostafa:GHSom3aa1980!@github.com/MohamedIsmailMostafa/hello-world

git show COMMIT_ID
git log
- Show current status of the project:
	git status
- Add a file(s) to staging area
	git add FileName
- Add everything in and beneath a folder (-A make sure to include deletions)
	git add -A .
- unstage/Remove (Reset) file from staging area
	git reset FileName
- Commit from staging area to the local repo: take a snapshot of the local repo
	git commit -m "Commit Message"
- Adding several files using wildcards	
	git add '*.txt'
	git add *.txt
	*Note in linux the qoutes so git recieve the wildcard.
- to see what we changed
	git log
	*will show all commits
- to see what we changed with summary
	git log --summary
- add a remote repository to our local repository, create the remote repo first
	git remote add REMOTE_REPO_NAME REMOTE_REPO_URL
	git remote add origin https://MohamedIsmailMostafa:GHSom3aa1980!@github.com/MohamedIsmailMostafa/git_try_repo.git
	git remote add origin https://MohamedIsmailMostafa:GHSom3aa1980!@github.com/MohamedIsmailMostafa/Learning.git
- remote remote repo from local repo:
	git remote remove REMOTE_REPO_NAME
	git remote remove origin
- Push: push command tells Git where to put out commits
	- git push REMOTE_REPO_NAME LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME
	- git push origin master
	- git push -u origin master --> -u tells git to remember the parameters so we can run next time "git push"
- Stash a changes of the working directory and index and go back to a clean working directory and match the HEAD commit.
	- git stash
	- git stash list --> to list the modifications
	- git stash show --> to inspect them
	- git stash apply --> to restorg

- Pull remote changes
	- git pull REMOTE_REPO LOCAL_REPO
	- git pull origin master
- Show diff from last commit, which refered to using HEAD pointer. it shows diff only for staged files
	- git diff HEAD -->only for files with committed version
	- git diff
	- git diff --staged --> show changes to only staged files.
	
- revert files to latest commit state
	git checkout -- FILE_NAME

- Create a branch
	git branch BRANCH_NAME
- Check out from new branch -- switch to a branch
	git checkout BRANCH_NAME
- Create a branch and check out in single command
	git checkout -b new_branch
- to list branches:
	git branch
- remove entire folder recursively
	git rm -r FOLDER
- merge 2 branches
	- git merge BRANCH
- delete branch
	- git branch -d BRANCH_NAME
- remove file
	git rm FILE_NAME
	git commit -a -m "message"
	git push origin master
